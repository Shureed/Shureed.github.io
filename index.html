              <p>I am Shureed Kabir, a current junior at Emory University. I began my college career
              as a pre-med student, but after taking a computer science course for fun, realized that
              software development is my passion. Although I may be late to the game, I have had the chance
              to create an Android app, participate in Hackerrank challenges, and undertook the challenge of
              an Artificial Intelligence course - and I'm only getting started.</p>

                  <p>InstaLeague is an Android application that allows users to create and join pick-up
                  games based on location. I initially used MongoDB and Node.js to create a REST API to
                  model data, then implemented the Parse SDK before the application launched on the
                  Google Play store. The FaceBook SDK was used to authenticate the user. This is a
                  personal project that began when I was curious as to what Android code looked like,
                  and eventually turned into a full-fledged application.</p>

                  LED lights are awesome, brought me to the idea of making an LED array whose output
                  depended on an audio source. An Arduino Nano was used as the heart of the system.</p>

                  <p>Before I realized that I loved computer science, I had an interest in chemistry and wanted deeper insight into the subject area.
                  I joined Dr. Lynn's lab at Emory University and was mentored by Rolando Rengifo. Dr. Lynn's lab was focused
                  on exploring self-assembling biomolecules, often analyzing molecules linked to Alzheimer's
                  disease. I was interested in this particular project because it involved building an organic nanobattery,
                  influenced by molecules involved in natural photosynthesis - I could imagine the countless applications
                      of energy sources at the macromolecular scale. </p>
