              <p>I am Shureed Kabir, a current junior at Emory University. I began my college career
              as a pre-med student and a chemistry major, but after taking a computer science course for fun, realized that
              software development is my passion. Although I may be late to the game, I have had the chance
              to create an Android app, participate in Hackerrank challenges, and undertook the challenge of
              an Artificial Intelligence course - and I'm only getting started.</p>

                      As an intern, I had the chance to work with an incredibly talented group of individuals.
                      Prior to the internship, I had no experience in SQL or VB.NET, but I quickly picked up the languages and
                      the .NET framework in order to contribute to the product. During the summer, I developed the Client Score Card, which measures support response
                      for each individual client. I have also worked on a custom network inventory system with the Roadmap team, which manages various network devices.
                      In addition, I also worked on suggestions submitted by clients through the H2O Ideas platform.
                      I had the honor of being nominated for the ACT TOP award in two categories: 1) Caring for Employers, Clients, and Community and for 2) Taking
                      Responsibility and Acting Like an Owner.

                  on exploring self-assembling biomolecules, often analyzing molecules linked to Alzheimer's
                  disease. I was interested in this particular project because it involved building an organic nanobattery,
